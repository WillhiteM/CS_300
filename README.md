\\Problem Solved
The main problem I worked on in this course was learning how to design and use different data structures to manage and process information efficiently. Each project required building programs that could load, organize, search, and display data effectively. The goal was to understand how data structures affect performance and to apply them to real programming problems.

\\Approach
I approached each project by breaking the problem into smaller parts and focusing on what data structure would work best for each task. I used vectors for storing data in order, hash tables for quick lookups, and binary search trees for keeping information sorted. Understanding how each structure worked helped me write programs that were faster and easier to manage.

\\Overcoming Roadblocks
There were times when my programs didn’t run as expected, particularly when working with file input or when data didn’t load correctly. To fix these problems, I used step-by-step testing and print statements to see where the code was failing. I also reviewed my algorithms to ensure the logic was correct before attempting to fix errors.

\\Expanding Software Design Approach
This project helped me think more carefully about how to design programs before I start writing code. I learned how important it is to plan out the structure and flow of a program, and to focus on reusing code where possible. I also got a better sense of how to make programs that can grow or be updated later without starting over.

\\Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code
Working through these projects changed the way I write code. I now use clear variable names, add comments that explain what each part does, and keep functions short and focused. I’ve also learned to think about how someone else might read or update my code in the future. This makes my programs easier to maintain and more adaptable to new requirements.
